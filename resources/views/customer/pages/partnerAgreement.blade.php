                                <h6>1. THE FIMI HUB PLATFORM</h6>
                                <p>1.1 You are an independent Contractor providing personal shopping, delivery, ride and
                                    errand services. As the FiMi Hub platform is not available to persons under the age of 18,
                                    you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that you have the right,
                                    authority, and capacity to enter into and abide by the terms of this Agreement. All
                                    independent contractors fall under one of the following categories: Driver partners,
                                    Delivery partners and Shopper partners. You are in lawful possession of all equipment,
                                    insurance, and licenses necessary to perform the shopping, driving and/or delivery
                                    services contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with all applicable laws. You
                                    desire to enter into this Agreement for the purpose of using the FiMi Hub Platform to
                                    obtain business opportunities to perform personal shopping and delivery services on
                                    behalf of consumers.</p>
                            <h6>2. CONTRACTOR’S POLICY</h6>
                            <h6>The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all Contractor fully understand and
                                follow FiMi Hub protocols while on the job</h6>
                            <p>2.1 Making a delivery while under the influence of intoxicants and other drugs (which
                                could impair driving ability) is forbidden and is sufficient cause for discipline, up to and
                                including termination of contract.</p>
                                <p>2.2 Cell phone use while driving should be kept to a minimum. Drivers need to be aware
                                    when use of the cell phone is creating a distraction from safe driving and adjust their
                                    usage accordingly, including pulling off the road to continue/finish the conversation if

                                    needed. While driving, attention to the road and safety should always take precedence
                                    over conducting business over the phone.</p>
                            <p>2.3 No unauthorized personnel are allowed to make deliveries on behalf of, or substitute
                                for any registered FiMi Hub driver. All persons providing a service for FiMi Hub MUST
                                be registered within the system and receive authorization. It is expected that only the
                                person and their registered motor vehicle are allowed to perform the services requested
                                through FiMi Hub.</p>
                            <p>2.4 All FiMi Hub drivers must adhere to the dress code when delivering to our customers
                                this include wearing of their Fimi Hub Polo Shirts, hats and mask and any other apparel
                                when delivering to our customers</p>
                            <p>2.5 At no point in time under any given circumstances should any Fimi Hub contractor be
                                disrespectful to customers. Customer satisfaction is our highest priority and we will be
                                very intolerant of any form of behavior or attitude that represents FiMi Hub in a manner
                                that is undesirable to the customer.</p>

                            <p>2.6 All Delivery Partners must exude flexibility and prioritize in efficiently delivering
                                customers or their goods on time.</p>
                            <h6>3. REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTING WITH FIMI HUB</h6>
                        <p>3.1 All Partners are required to submit the following documents listed below in order to
                            perform the services of FiMi Hub. However, due to delays caused by backlog in
                            processing and brought on by the current pandemic, FiMi Hub will allow individuals who
                            have met our minimum requirements and have been successful in the interview to begin

                            either a pastor or a Justice of the Peace). Contractors will then be given a 60-day grace

                                mobile application. Failure to submit these documents will result in suspension or
                                termination of the Contractor’s account.</p>
                            <h6>4. SERVICES OF THE CONTRACTOR</h6>

                                delivery services through the FiMi Hub Platform on behalf of consumers (a “Delivery

                                Opportunity”). If you accept a Delivery Opportunity, you agree to use the FiMi Hub
                                Platform to retrieve the requested retail items from the store selected by the
                                customer and deliver them in a safe and timely manner in accordance with the
                                delivery window requested by the customer.</p>
                            <p>4.2 You acknowledge that you, as a prerequisite to performing the Services, in your
                                capacity as an individual will need to consent to background checks, as continued access
                                to the FiMi Hub Platform is contingent upon passing the background checks and
                                otherwise complying with the terms of this Agreement (and any documents incorporated
                                by reference). After receiving access to the FiMi Hub Platform, FiMi Hub may conduct
                                additional background checks on you, in compliance with applicable law, through its
                                background check provider. FiMi Hub will issue you a username and password so that
                                you can access the FiMi Hub Platform to provide the Services. You agree that only you
                                will use the username and password, as you are the sole authorized user.</p>
                            <p>4.3 You acknowledge that FiMi Hub does not impose any minimum or maximum amount
                                of Services that you are required to provide. Moreover, you are under no obligation to
                                accept any particular Delivery Opportunity that is offered to you. You are free to accept
                                or reject any Delivery Opportunity, in your business judgment and discretion. If,
                                however, you do accept a Delivery Opportunity, then you are contractually obligated to
                                complete it. You further agree to accept liability for any and all damages resulting from
                                your or your Personnel’s failure to complete a Delivery Opportunity in accordance with
                                the terms set forth in this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>4.4 You agree that there is no minimum or maximum number of Delivery Opportunities
                                that FiMi Hub will make available to you. You further agree that FiMi Hub does not
                                dictate the time of the performance of the Services.</p>
                                <p>4.5 If FiMi Hub desires to engage you for any purposes other than or in addition to the
                                    Services, and if you agree to such an additional engagement, you and FiMi Hub shall
                                    agree upon the specific terms and conditions. However, such terms and conditions shall
                                    govern that additional engagement only and shall not modify the terms and conditions
                                    governing the Services as set forth in this Agreement. Any disputes or claims arising out
                                    of or related to the provision of such additional engagement shall be governed by the
                                    Arbitration Provision included in this Agreement.</p>
                                <p>4.6 The Parties acknowledge that the term of this Agreement does not reflect an
                                    uninterrupted service arrangement. Each Delivery Opportunity you accept shall be treated
                                    as a separate contractual engagement, with no continuing obligation to provide Services.
                                    No Services will be performed without the Parties’ mutual agreement.</p>
                            <h6>5. RATES AND PAYMENT</h6>
                                    <p>5.1 FiMi Hub agrees to pay drivers a flat rate of no less than 85% of each delivery fee.
                                        FiMi Hub reserves the right to change the rates for payment components at any time, and
                                        FiMi Hub will provide you with notice of the changes in advance of your accepting a
                                        Delivery Opportunity through FiMi Hub’s Customer App. FiMi Hub does not pay
                                        earnings by salary or by an hourly rate.</p>
                                <p>5.2 For a Delivery Opportunity that involves both personal shopping and delivery, you
                                    will be provided a payment for each delivery, which takes into account factors such as
                                    number and types of items, estimated distance and time, and any applicable incentive.
                                    Payment components are shown in the Customer App, and you can review the applicable
                                    estimated earnings prior to accepting or rejecting a Delivery Opportunity.</p>
                                <p>5.3 For a Delivery Opportunity that involves delivery only, you will be provided a
                                    payment for each delivery. Payment components are shown in the Customer App, and
                                    you can review the applicable estimated earnings prior to accepting or rejecting a
                                    Delivery Opportunity.</p>
                                    <p>5.4 As a condition of receiving payment, you agree to provide FiMi Hub with your
                                        taxpayer identification number and the requisite authorization for required background
                                        checks. You shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred or necessary in the
                                        performance of the Services, including but not limited to phone, parking, vehicle,
                                        insurance, and travel expenses.</p>
                                    <p>5.5 You may request that FiMi Hub make earnings payable in your name or in your
                                        capacity as a sole proprietorship, trade, or other corporate or business entity.</p>

                                        retaliation; violation of any local. This includes all claims that arose before the signing of

                                        of this Agreement</p>
                                    <p>A Claim under this Section also includes all claims or disputes between you and any third
                                        party retailer arising out of or related to the Services performed under this Agreement that

                                        consumer reporting agency. Any disputes or claims in this regard shall be resolved
                                        exclusively by an arbitrator.</p>

                                        brought before such agency as required by law, and that after exhaustion of
                                        administrative remedies, the Claim must be pursued through this binding arbitration
                                        procedure to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
                                    <p>10.3 Waiver of Class Action Claims. By signing this Agreement, FiMi Hub and you
                                        agree that each may bring and pursue claims against the other only in their individual
                                        capacities, and may not bring, pursue or act as a plaintiff, class representative, or class
                                        member in any purported class or collective proceeding or action.</p>
                                        <p>10.4 Claims Not Covered. This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between
                                            you (as a party or class member) and FiMi Hub pending in a state or federal court or
                                            arbitration as of the date of your receipt of this Agreement. Claims not covered by this
                                            Agreement are claims for workers’ compensation benefits, unemployment compensation
                                            benefits, or any other claims that as a matter of controlling law cannot be arbitrated.
                                            Nothing in this Agreement prohibits you from exercising rights protected under the
                                            National Labor Relations Act or from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with
                                            the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities
                                            and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal
                                            Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the investigation by
                                            a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration
                                            Provision. Disputes or claims between FiMi Hub and any third party beneficiaries are not
                                            covered by the terms of this Arbitration Provision.</p>
                                    <p>10.5(a) Opt-Out for Arbitration Provision. You have 30 calendar days from the date
                                        you sign this Agreement to opt-out of the Arbitration Provision. However, opting-out of
                                        this Arbitration Provision does not affect any other part of this Agreement. If you opt-

                                        out of the Arbitration Provision, then neither you nor FiMi Hub will be bound by the
                                        terms of this Arbitration Provision. Should you not opt-out in accordance with this
                                        Section within the 30 day period, then this Arbitration Provision will become fully
                                        effective and binding as of the date the Agreement is executed by you. If you agreed to
                                        a previous arbitration agreement with FiMi Huband opt out of this Arbitration
                                        Provision, you remain bound by that prior arbitration agreement and must arbitrate
                                        any and all claims or disputes covered by that prior arbitration agreement, regardless
                                        of whether those claims or disputes arise after the date you execute this Agreement.</p>

                                        This should not be construed as precluding you from hiring individuals to assist in the
