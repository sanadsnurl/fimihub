                            <p>If you are not happy with your purchase, we will accept a return of a unused product within 7 days.
                                Once we receive the returned item FiMi Hub will then give a full refund (excluding shipping as we are
                                unable to refund the initial shipping cost of your order).</p>

                            <p>Please allow 1-2 weeks for your return to be processed.</p>

                            <p>Discounted items are not eligible for a return.</p>
                            <p>FiMi Hub will not issue refunds for products purchased through other entities, such as distributors or
                                retail partners.</p>
                            <p>Returned items must be delivered to us unused, in original packaging and in the condition they were
                                    received or may not be eligible for refund or be subject to a restocking fee. We cannot be held
                                    responsible for items damaged or lost in return shipment, therefore we recommend an insured and
                                    trackable mail service.</p>
                            <p>We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the item(s) or proof of received return
                                        delivery.</p>
                            <p>We aim to accept all returns. In the unlikely event that an item is returned to us in an unsuitable
                                condition, we may have to send it back to you. All goods will be inspected on return.</p>
