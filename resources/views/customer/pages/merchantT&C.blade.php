                                with all applicable laws (including tax, gratuity, social security and employment laws where
                                applicable) regarding the distribution of any gratuities.</p>
                            <h6>5.2 Retail Prices; Taxes</h6>  
                            <p>FIMI HUB Services connect you with Customers who wish to purchase your Items. You are
                                the “merchant”, “retailer”, or “seller” of all Items to be made available for sale via the FIMI
                                HUB App. As such, you are responsible for determining and setting the retail price for each
                                Item, and you are ultimately responsible for the collection and remittance of all applicable
                                Sales Taxes, where required under applicable law. The term “Sales Tax” includes any sales,
                                sellers use, transaction privilege, privilege, general excise, gross receipts, and similar
                                transaction taxes, as well as any bottle, bag, plastic, or other similar fees. For the sake of
                                clarity, the Retail Price for each Item excludes separately stated Sales Taxes.
                                Merchant hereby authorizes FiMi Hub to collect applicable Sales Taxes on Merchant's behalf
                                based on information provided by Merchant through the FIMI HUB Tools. The FIMI HUB
                                Tools’ functionality may be based on interpretations of federal, state, and local laws and
                                regulations and information provided by taxing authorities. Merchant’s use of the FIMI HUB Tools, including any communications with FiMi Hub, in no way constitutes the provision of
                                legal or tax advice.</p>  
                            <p>Merchant shall promptly notify FiMi Hub if it believes any charges (or lack of charges) for
                                Sales Taxes were erroneous or inaccurate. If Sales Taxes charged by Merchant are not in
                                accordance with (or in violation of) any law or regulation, FiMi Hub expressly reserves the
                                right to, upon prior notice to Merchant, remove affected Items from Merchant’s menu on the
                                FIMI HUB App and/or deactivate Merchant from the FIMI HUB App.

                                price that is higher than the price that Merchant charges in-store for similar Items. Merchant
                                agrees that you will not make an Item available under this Agreement at a price higher than
                                the amount Merchant is charging for similar Items through any comparable platform for food

                            <h6>5.4 Appointment of Limited Payment Collection Agent</h6>  
                            <p>Merchant is solely responsible for providing FiMi Hub with, and maintaining, accurate bank
                                account information. Merchant hereby appoints FiMi Hub and its affiliates, as the case may
                                be, as Merchant’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of: (i) accepting
                                payment of the Retail Price of Items sold by Merchant via the FIMI HUB App plus any
                                applicable Sales Tax collected on Merchant’s behalf, via the payment processing
                                functionality facilitated by the FIMI HUB Tools, and (ii) remitting the Retail Price plus Sales
                                Tax collected on Merchant’s behalf less the retained Fee and, if applicable, any refunds given
                                to Customers on behalf of Merchant (“Item Revenue”). Further, Merchant agrees that
                                payment collected on its behalf by FiMi Hub or its affiliates will be considered the same as payment made directly to Merchant. Merchant agrees that if Merchant does not receive
                                payment from FiMi Hub or its affiliates, Merchant’s only recourse will be against FiMi Hub
                                and its affiliates. FiMi Hub and its affiliates may, from time to time, request information from
                                Merchant to confirm Merchant’s identity as may be necessary under any applicable
                                compliance obligations before remitting any amounts to Merchant and may refuse to process
                                amounts owed to Merchant if there exists a legal or regulatory risk or potential breach of law
                                or regulation associated with such remittance to Merchant. Merchant agrees that FiMi Hub
                                and its affiliates may describe or otherwise reflect the terms of this Section, in any terms of
                                use, receipts, disclosures, or notices that may be deemed necessary or prudent. If reasonable,
                                FiMi Hub may adjust the remittance of Item Revenue collected on Merchant’s behalf for
                                reasons including failure to fulfil an Item as ordered or making a correction on an Item.
                                Merchant may identify any disagreements in connection with such adjustments through the
                                FIMI HUB Tools. FiMi Hub and its affiliates reserve the right to collect any amounts in
                                connection with such adjustments via a deduction from the remittance of Item Revenue
                                collected on Merchant’s behalf, by debiting the payment method or Merchant’s bank account
                                on record, or otherwise seeking reimbursement from Merchant by any lawful collection
                                methods available. Merchant authorizes FiMi Hub and its affiliates to use any or all of the
                                above methods to seek such adjustments and reimbursements. In more serious situations,
                                such as fraud (including any charges for Items that Customers did not place) or Customer
                                complaints, FiMi Hub and its affiliates reserve the right to cancel a payment entirely. By
                                agreeing to these terms, Merchant gives FiMi Hub and its affiliates express consent to adjust
                                payments collected on Merchant’s behalf as set forth in this Section.</p>

                                preparer, whether the item is “ready-to-eat”, or intended use. Merchant is solely responsible
                                for providing requested Additional Information to FiMi Hub in a timely manner. If Merchant
                                fails to provide Additional Information in a timely manner in response to notification and
                                request by FiMi Hub, FiMi Hub expressly reserves the right to temporarily remove affected
                                Items from Merchant’s menu on the FIMI HUB App until such Additional Information is
                                received.

                                FiMi Hub will also provide reasonable information regarding any refunds given to

                                and any other information FiMi Hub is permitted to provide under applicable privacy laws
                                and terms with Customers. To the extent applicable, Merchant agrees that FiMi Hub may

                                Merchant’s parent company or Franchisor.

                                    or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible
                                    for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether this
                                    Agreement is unconscionable or illusory and any defence to arbitration, including waiver,
                                    delay, laches, or estoppel. In the event of a dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement, the complaining party shall notify the other party
                                    in writing thereof. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, representatives of both parties
                                    shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. Should the dispute not be resolved
                                    within thirty (30) days after such notice, the complaining party shall seek remedies
                                    exclusively through arbitration. Furthermore, the parties agree: <br> i) The Arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered
                                    by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that
                                    any award may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction. I) A party who desires
                                    to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration
                                    as specified by the rules governing arbitration. <br> ii) The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English.</p>
                                <h6>17.2 Waiver of Jury Trial</h6>    
                                <p>Each party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it
                                    may have to a trial by jury of any arbitrable claim under this Agreement and in
                                    connection with the enforcement of an arbitral award rendered pursuant to this agreement.
                                    Each party (i) certifies that no representatives, agent or attorney of any other party has
                                    represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of such
                                    litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other
                                    party hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement.</p>
                                <h5>18. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION.</h5>    
                                <p>Merchant will not, in its use of the FIMI HUB Services or Tools under this Agreement,
                                    discriminate against any customer, employee, contractor or other person or individual on
                                    the basis of race, colour, gender, pregnancy, marital status, familial status, sexual
                                    orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, or Merchant will not, in its use of the FIMI HUB Services or Tools under this Agreement,
                                    discriminate against any customer, employee, contractor or other person or individual on
                                    the basis of race, colour, gender, pregnancy, marital status, familial status, sexual

                                <h5>19. ADDITIONAL TERMS</h5>  
                                <p>The territory of this Agreement is Jamaica, and all payments issued under this Agreement
                                    must be in Jamaican dollars. Merchant agrees to receive calls, SMS messages and other
                                    communications, including those made available by autodialer, sent by or on behalf of
                                    FiMi Hub or its affiliates. In this Agreement, “including” means “including, without
                                    limitation,” and examples are illustrative and not the sole examples of a particular
                                    concept. The failure of either party to enforce, at any time or for any period of time, the
                                    provisions hereof, or the failure of either party to exercise any option herein, will not be
                                    construed as a waiver of such provision or option and will in no way affect that party’s
                                    right to enforce such provisions or exercise such option. This Agreement may not be
                                    assigned, transferred, delegated or subcontracted, in whole or in part, by a party without
                                    the prior written consent of the other party, provided that each party may assign this
                                    Agreement, upon written notice to the other party, (a) to an affiliate of such party, or (b)
                                    in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of such party’s equity, business or
                                    assets to which this Agreement relates; provided that in the event of any such transfer by
                                    Merchant, Merchant explicitly consents that any such transferee will have access to and
                                    control of all Merchant accounts related to such transfer, including its accounts with FiMi
                                    Hub, access to historical reporting information about Items related to such transfer, and
                                    other account data relating to such transfer. In the event of a change of ownership
                                    involving Merchant’s Location(s), the parties will need to execute a Change of Ownership form and Merchant acknowledges and agrees that the Location will not be
                                    able to accept or process any Customer orders on the FIMI HUB Customer App until the
                                    Change of Ownership is executed. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
                                    binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each party hereto and its respective
                                    successors and assigns. Any purported assignment, transfer, delegation or subcontract in
                                    violation of this Section will be null and void. In the event any provision of this
                                    Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by ruling of an arbitrator or a
                                    court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement (and each of the
                                    remaining terms and conditions contained herein) will remain in full force and effect. Any
                                    delay in or failure by either party in the performance of this Agreement will be excused if
                                    and to the extent such delay or failure is caused by occurrences beyond the control of the
                                    affected party including decrees or restraints of Government, acts of God, strikes, work
                                    stoppage or other labour disturbances, war or sabotage (each being a “Force Majeure
                                    Event”). The affected party will promptly notify the other party upon becoming aware
                                    that any Force Majeure has occurred or is likely to occur and will use commercially
                                    reasonable efforts to minimize any resulting delay in or interference with the performance
                                    of its obligations under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to
                                    create any joint venture, joint enterprise, or agency relationship among the parties (except
                                    as otherwise expressly set forth above), and no party will have the right to enter into
                                    contracts on behalf of, to legally bind, to incur debt on behalf of, or to otherwise incur any
                                    liability or obligation on behalf of, the other party hereto, in the absence of a separate
                                    writing, executed by an authorized representative of the other party. Each party will be
                                    solely responsible for its employees and contractors used in connection with such party’s
                                    performance obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement contains the full and
                                    complete understanding and agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporary understandings and agreements,
                                    whether oral or written, relating such subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be
                                    executed in one or more counterparts and by exchange of electronically signed
                                    counterparts transmitted by PDF format, each of which will be deemed an original and all
                                    of which, when taken together, will constitute one and the same original instrument.</p>
